        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The team at The Valhalla Project have, as always, been looking at new ways to improve both our efficiency and our safety. You are all well aware of our recent fit changes ... (We hope you liked them!) which improved our site speeds, and reduced our losses.</p>
        <p>However this change did show us that, even great players, with great fits, can occasionally run into a cascade of events which results in the loss of their ship, entirely out of their control.</p>
        <p>So we sat down as a collective team and decided that we were not happy with this. It's not cool to be a great player with a great ship, and lose stuff anyway!</p>
        <p>So we have overhauled how we do things. We've pulled together some key aspects of our general running procedures as well.</p>
        <p>The key to this is a new initiative called <a href="javascript:showOwnerDetails(98314241)">The Valhalla Project Boosters and Insurance Ltd</a> Corporation.</p>
        <h3>Logistics</h3>
        <p>This will continue as before without change, meaning logistics ships lost during a fleet action will automatically receive upto 250 mil as usual outside of the new ship insurance corporation.</p>
        <h3>Boosters</h3>
        <p>Our players are also well aware of the strength and necessities of our boosters, tipping them to ensure they keep coming, to make sure we are always flying at our safest, and we thank you for that.</p>
        <p>If you are one of the players who dilligently wants to reward boosters for their long (nearly a year) training and kindness, often logging on at a moments notice to ensure fleet safety, you can continue to do so by tipping the corporation (Please ensure you use the reason box to say Booster Tip).</p>
        <p>You can also tip with your initial payment for insurance.</p>

        <h3>When Joining the Fleet</h3>
        <p>When you first join the fleet send 15 million isk for ship insurance. Make sure your ship is within the paramaters above. Tip <a href="javascript:CCPEVE.showInfo(2, 98314241)">The Valhalla Project Boosters and Insurance Ltd</a> Corporation.</p>
        <h3>When Leaving the Fleet</h3>
        <p>Upon leaving the fleet; please send your usual booster tips to the corp too (Put "Booster tip" in the reason box please).</p>
        <h3>Or...</h3>
        <p>You can make a combined payment, make sure to put "insurance/booster tip" in the reason box.</p>

        <p>If you lose your ship, you will receive the hull value minus insurance value, plus any fitted modules that did not drop, as long as you paid 15mil into the corp in the last 24hrs, as long as the following guidelines are met:</p>
        <h3>Guidlines</h3>
        <p>- Due to pilot abuse, that pay their insurance only when aggresed we have introduced a 15 minuete timer. Insurance needs to have been paid 15 mins before your kill mail (This does not apply to your first site)</p>
        <p>-Your loss mail was less than 24 hours from your premium payment (subjecy to the new 15 min rule).</p>
        <p>-Your loss was inside a site with the fleet.</p>
        <p>-Your loss was not the result of you being afk without first advising the FC.</p>
        <p>-Your ship's tank is fit exactly as you linked it when you 'x'd up' for a fleet invite.</p>
        <p>-Your kill mail is sent to your Fleet FC with details of the loss from your point of view for forwarding to insurance team</p>

        <h4>We cannot cover</h4>
        <p>-Loss by pvp (ganks, wardecs, killrights)</p>
        <p>-Officer modules.</p>
