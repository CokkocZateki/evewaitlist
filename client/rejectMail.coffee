Thank you for using the TVP Waitlist... I hope you are enjoying using it as much as the FC team!

The current FC has deemed your fit not up to standard, this could be for any number of reasons, from a lack of tank, through to too much tank reducing your applied damage.

We would be most appreciative if you could click 'fits' at the top of the waitlist site and adjust yours accordingly. Please do remember that the faction fits only work with faction modules! You cannot simply replace them with T2. If you are using T2 modules, you must use the T2 fit.

Once your fit is fixed, simply add the updated fit to the waitlist.

Hope to see you in fleet soon!
The TVP FC Team
