We perform the following local data refreshes periodically:

 - Refresh the "refresh token" for a character.
 - Refresh the location for a character.

We check the character location every 10 seconds if:

 - they are currently online viewing the waitlist

We check the character location every minute if:

 - they are known to be online ingame

We check all players at least once every 30 mins.
